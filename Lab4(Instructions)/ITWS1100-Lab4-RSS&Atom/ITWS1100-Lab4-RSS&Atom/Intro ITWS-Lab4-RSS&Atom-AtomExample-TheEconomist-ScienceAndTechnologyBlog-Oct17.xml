      <title>Parkour’s street stuntmen resent the sport’s new organisers</title>

      <description>A SHIRTLESS man floats through the air, some six or seven stories from the ground. Behind him is the roof of a grubby block of flats. At least five metres (16ft) in front of him and a couple down is another building. Tucked like a diver, he leaps above the abyss, rolls into his landing and sprints away.</description>

      <link>https://www.economist.com/blogs/gametheory/2017/10/runnin-down-dream?fsrc=rss</link>
      <description>IT IS one of running’s three great barriers. The first, a sub-four-minute mile, was achieved in 1954 by Britain’s Sir Roger Bannister, on a gusty day at Oxford University’s dusty cinder track.</description>

      <description>THE story of the 2017 Major League Baseball (MLB) season has been the home run. Just three years after a lull in run-scoring sometimes called the “little deadball era”, when offence hit its lowest mark since 1981, equilibrium has been restored almost exclusively on the back of the long ball.</description>

Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, the two men who dominated men’s tennis from 2005-10, have enjoyed a startling resurgence in 2017, splitting the year’s four grand-slam titles.</description>

      <description>IN A US Open women’s singles event full of upsets and surprises, the most unexpected outcome of them all was the success of the American contingent. For the first time in 36 years, all four of the semi-finalists hailed from the host country.</description>

      <description>CRICKETING aficionados had expected a record-shattering deal, and they were right. On September 4th the Indian Premier League (IPL), a domestic tournament which uses the abridged Twenty20 (T20) format, announced that it had signed a five-year contract worth $2.55bn for its worldwide broadcasting and digital rights.</description>

Teammates routinely need to communicate on the field, above all so that catchers can tell pitchers what type of pitch to throw.</description>

      <description>WITH FORMER champions Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, and Stan Wawrinka all missing from this year’s US Open, which began on August 28th, a throng of less-familiar names headed to Flushing with a chance to make a name for themselves.</description>

      <description>IT HAS been a while since men’s tennis last featured a rising star who had realised his full potential. In the era of the “big four”, in which Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have dominated the sport like no previous quartet, there has been a steady stream of young contenders.</description>

      <title>Why Neymar is different</title>

Four summers ago the club outfought all opposition to sign the golden boy of Brazilian football, a 21-year-old known only as Neymar. Details soon emerged of the financial acrobatics used to sign him up: his transfer fee was not €57m ($76m), as advertised to interested parties and tax collectors, but in fact €86m.</description>

      <description>IT WAS a result that almost nobody wanted or expected. On July 8th, as the match-ending siren sounded in the third and final test of the British and Irish Lions’ tour to New Zealand, the scores were level at 15-15, meaning that the series had finished with a 1-1 tie.</description>

      <description>ANGELIQUE KERBER’S (pictured, left) reign at the top of the world rankings for women’s tennis came to an end on July 10th, when Garbiñe Muguruza (right) of Spain knocked her out of Wimbledon in the fourth round.</description>
