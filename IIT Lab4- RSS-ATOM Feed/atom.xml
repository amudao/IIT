            <summary>Microsoft has Minecraft, Epic Games has Fortnite, and Sony now has Destiny. 
        In a $3.6 billion deal, Sony is acquiring Bungie, the game studio famous for 
        creating the Halo and Destiny universes. It's a big deal, in a month already full 
        of massive deals. It's also backed by some equally big promises from Bungie 
        about its independence, the future of Destiny, and commitments to multiplatform games.</summary>

            <summary>They say that all press is good press, and case in point, I'd never even 
        heard of the game Martha is Dead until it started making headlines for Sony 
        demanding that parts of it be cut in order for release on PlayStation.</summary>

            <summary> Insiders pointed out that Netflix's renewal rate for scripted series 
        that have two or more seasons stands at 60 percent, in line with industry 
        averages, and, like all Netflix renewal verdicts, the decision was made by 
        balancing the show's viewership and cost. The streamer also prides itself 
        on taking big swings on projects like Cowboy Bebop and has many other 
        genre shows on the air and in the works.</summary>
