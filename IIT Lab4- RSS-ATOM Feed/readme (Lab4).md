# Thoughts on Lab4
I had fun choosing the articles in the atom and rss feed. I chose aarticles I found entertaining and I wanted to spread them to others. The lab was fun. 
Only negative I had when completing the lab, was me realizing how much I missed playing Returnal. It's such an amazing game.

## Styling
There is no styling in the xml files
