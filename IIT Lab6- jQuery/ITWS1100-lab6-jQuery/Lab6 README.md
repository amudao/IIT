## General Info
This project is based on designing and validating forms to take information from the user in an orderly manner using JQuery. Project is based on editing specific part of the form so it follows a standard pattern.
***

## Working
Project tasks us to implement function that allows specific part (h1) to be edited to allow the users input to be implemented or edited. User must create a function that allows specific texts in the form to disappear vanish over a certain time. Another function must also allow the text to be reverted to its original position.
***

## Styling
Add class tag with Input is used in the code and css has been used to style the text field that is when the cursor clicks certain part, the color of the text field changes to red.

## Impressions
General Feelings
I had fun working on this lab, wasn't to difficult. I took me a little bit to get used to javascript but after I got over the learning curve it just mellowed out.
