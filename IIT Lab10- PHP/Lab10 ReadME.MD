## General Info

The general information of the lab is that we were provided with an SQL file with the commands to create an actors table and insert some actors. I have also provided you with a PHP program which has a menu with two tabs. One will add/remove/display actors, however there is no table for the actors. The other is to do the same for movies, and while I have given you the table, I have not given you the code for the movies.php program. 

Lab 10 involves using the information already provided to us to write code that can be used to  Add/Remove and display both movies and actors.  Using code we write we must be able to add/remove/display the newly added actors and movies in our already established list of actors and movies.

## Working 
 We work and store our files in XAMP in the file system. After saving our files in the XAMP file system, we then able to start implementing the files in phpMyAdmin. This acts as a way for us to see and view our sql database. Our movies.sql database is uploaded to phpMyAdmin and then we make a new database table called actors. This new database table is where we store new actors that will be added to the forms.

## Final Info
 In order for the forms to work, we need to run it through local host. Our local host is stored in iit and we run it to access the database stored in phpMyAdmin.
