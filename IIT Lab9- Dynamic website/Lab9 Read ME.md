## General Info
This project is based on creating an INDEX page with basic information of myself and a PROJECT page that includes all my previous and upcoming lab projects. It contains links to the lab projects file. By writing JSON and JavaScript we are able to create a dynamically sound website. The written Javascript is used to validate and read the AJAX file that contains the project.html file.


## Working
When we land on the website it directs us to the home page i.e INDEX page then using the menu bar we can navigate to the PROJECT page where there are several buttons linked to the lab projects.
By clicking on the buttons we are redirected to the particular lab project's webpage.

## Styling
To arrange and align the contents in a respective manner flexbox container has been used. Also used a background image so that the background looks cool.

## Overall feeling of Lab9
I took me a while to understand and learn the in and out of Ajax and JSON but after a few hours I was able to understand it a little bit.
