## General Info
This project is based on designing and validating forms to take information from the user in an orderly manner using javascript.
***

## Working
There is a form in which all fields are required to be filled. In case the user did not fill any of the fields the web page will give an alert message prompting to complete the particular field. There is a button which prompts you the FirstName Lastname and NickName entered by the user. At last there is a submit button that allows you to submit the form only if all the fields have been filled properly by the user.
***

## Styling
Form tag with Input is used throughout the code and css has been used to style the text field that is when the cursor hovers the field its background color changes.
