      <h1>Lab 3: Build a Website</h1>
      <h2>Intro ITWS</h2>

      <h3>Create a personal Intro to IT website in your
      <a href="#">RCS iit directory</a></h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The web site will be placed in an "iit" subdirectory of your
          RCS file space, and it must be RCS password protected: you will give rights to Megha and me. Follow
          <a href="#">these
          instructions</a> to set up your protected directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Guidelines:
          <ul>
            <li>
              You must have at least two pages: home and projects.
              Name these files:
              <ul>
                <li>index.html (this will be your landing page, or home page)</li>
                <li>projects.html (this will be the main page to introduce your labs)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              You must have a consistent header, menu, content area, and footer.
            </li>
            <li>The only file in your root (iit) folder (at the root of your site) is the index.html page</li>
            <li>
              All resources (e.g. CSS files) should be kept in a separate area(s) as per your design.
            </li>
            <li>
              Populate your projects page with links to the labs,
              beginning with your resume; continue to do this as we move forward this semester.
            </li>
            <li>
              As before, your code must be valid and properly indented.  (And
              don't forget to set the &lt;title&gt; tag on each page.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          We will work through some of this together in class.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will graded using the <a href="#">Lab 3 rubric</a> as a guideline.  Creativity will be rewarded.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have included an HTML template to help you get started: <a href="#">HTML5 template</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Feel free to experiment and be creative - and <strong>use the web
          as a reference!!</strong> (e.g. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>
          <strong>This lab is due by the date on the LMS assigment panel</strong>
          It must be posted to your <a href="#">RCS iit
          directory</a>.</p>

          <p>Please create a plain text file, named README.md (or txt) file in your root directory and with comments about the lab, justifications for your chosen methods/styles/tech, etc.  In the file, include the correct URL for your site.
          </p>
          <p>Include your outlines that you created in the IA class.</p>

          <p>
          Create a zip file of your iit directory, name it - <em><strong>yourRCSid</strong>-ITWS1100-Lab3.zip</em> and submit it to the <em>Assignments</em> area of LMS.  (in it will contain your site's root directory, your HTML, CSS, README, and any other files/resources relevant to your site)

          <p>Include a <a href="#url"><strong>working URL</strong></a> to your RCS iit directory in the assignment comments and in your README files.
          </p>
          <p id="url">
            The URL should look like:<br/>
            <a href="javascript:alert('This link won\'t work, but yours should ;-D')">https://afsws.rpi.edu/AFS/home/<strong><em>yourNum</em>/<em>yourRcsId</em></strong>/public_html/iit/</a>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
