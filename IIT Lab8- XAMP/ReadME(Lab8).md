## General Info
This lab focuses on the introduction to Lamp stack and the uses of application like XAMP to host files, and build to build websites and host servers/site offline, on a local web server on your computer.

## Working
The purpose of today's lab was to write basic and simple script tag that could be used to manipulate or be implemented with a users input. We wrote simple script tags that when inputted by the user it directs them to a new website. This code in the background backend of the server waiting until the user execute this specific tag.

## Links
"<script>location.href="http://www.rpi.edu";</script>"

## Productivity

When the text was inserted into the comment section an onclick event is triggered when the user clicked submit and this runs whatever is inside the comment. The script tag which we wrote to redirect the user to a new page or a new website was already inside the code The onclick event was triggered when the user submitted the form.
